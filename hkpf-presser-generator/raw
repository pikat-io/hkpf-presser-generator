The Commissioner of Police, Mr Lo Wai-chung,  inspected a passing-out parade of probationary inspectors and recruit police constables as a reviewing officer at the Hong Kong Police College today (November 16).




 In his speech, Mr Lo encouraged the passing-out officers to stand firm to their values, stay honest and aboveboard, and keep confident, in order to rise to the challenges arising from threats on public safety and order under the current social unrest.




 He said, "We must not forget our aspirations in joining the Force, which is to complete the solemn missions of upholding the rule of law and fighting crimes."



 Mr Lo mentioned that the overall crime figure in 2018 dropped to 54,225 cases, the figure was the lowest since 1974. It could only be achieved by the joint efforts of Police and the general public. He hoped Police would continue to adhere to the people-oriented principle in serving the community, so as to keep Hong Kong safe and stable.




 He also noted that a number of surveys in recent years showed that the public has full confidence in the Force as people’s satisfaction rate on Police service was getting new high in the surveys.  The Police Service Satisfaction Survey in 2018 showed that 84 per cent of the respondents were satisfied with Police’s overall service performance. It’s the highest percentage among similar surveys since 2000. Nearly 80 per cent of the respondents expressed confidence in the Force in the Public Opinion Survey conducted in 2018 as well.




 Mr Lo said that although a series of incidents occurred in the past few months have brought great challenges to the relationship between Police and the community, as long as the Force stays united and remains steadfast, discharges duties in an honest and aboveboard manner, and continues to enforce the law impartially, the Force will certainly have the support and trust from Hong Kong citizens and tide over the current difficulties one day.




 Upon leaving the Force after more than a third of a century of service, Mr Lo said, “My heart is always with the Force. It is my greatest honour to be able to lead this world-class professional police force.”



 In closing, he quoted classical Cantonese lyrics and hoped Hong Kong people could stay united to make Hong Kong a better place.The Commissioner of Police, Mr Lo Wai-chung, speaks at the passing-out parade at the Hong Kong Police College today (November 16).The Commissioner of Police, Mr Lo Wai-chung, reviews the passing-out parade at the Hong Kong Police College today (November 16).

Up to this morning, Tolo Highway had been maliciously blocked. For the safety of citizens and road users, Police have worked with other Government departments to clear the debris on Tolo Highway. Parts of the southbound and northbound Tolo Highway have been re-opened.




 Police appeal to all members of the public not to throw any object off the bridge or conduct any illegal acts posing threat to road users. Due to the current situation, drivers are advised to stay tuned when they pass by the location concerned.
For days, rioters have been inflicting extensive damage to various districts, and blocking multiple key public routes and harbour-crossing facilities. These acts pose a serious threat to public safety and order. Up to 10am today (November 15), Tolo Highway had been maliciously blocked for over 60 hours, seriously obstructing emergency services and movement of residents in the New Territories.




 Police are aware that rioters claimed they would re-open part of the southbound and northbound Tolo Highway at around 6am today to facilitate temporary resumption of traffic. Nonetheless, the highway is still blocked by miscellaneous objects and shattered glass, posing a serious threat to road users’ safety.




 When the relevant Government departments attempted to clear the debris on the highway, some rioters used bows, arrows and other hard objects to intimidate the contract workers. Since the highway is still filled with hard objects and devoid of any road signs or traffic cones, re-opening the road would certainly cause danger to road users.




 As Tolo Highway remains blocked, to protect the safety of citizens and road users, Police are making immense effort to liaise with other Government departments to remove the debris in a bid to resume normal traffic as soon as possible.




 Police express deep regret that the rioters continue to paralyse transport network and blatantly disregard public concern. Police once again appeal to the Chinese University of Hong Kong to keep their promise and help restore social stability and road safety.

To de-escalate the situation, Police and Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have reached a consensus in search for a peaceful solution. However, the situation in CUHK continues to intensify. As Police officers were retreating, rioters threw bricks, petrol bombs, launched arrows and even fired a signal flare at Police officers. Such violence has reached a deadly level, posing a serious threat to Police officers and everyone at scene. The rioters threw hard objects and petrol bombs onto Tolo Highway, endangering road users’ safety. The rioters also hampered emergency services including ambulance services.




 Having given repeated warning in vain, Police have no choice but to deploy the minimum necessary force, including a Specialised Crowd Management Vehicle, to facilitate retreat.




 Police warn all rioters to stop all illegal and violent acts, and to leave immediately. Police express regret over the fact that the rioters had defied an agreement made between Police and the University.
As the night fell, the situation remained tense in Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). In pursuit of a peaceful solution to defuse the situation, Police have communicated with the school and are arranging a retreat to stop the standoff. Police appeal to protestors to stop charging. A Specialised Crowd Management Vehicle is at the scene and will be deployed to assist a retreat if necessary.




 In the meantime, the protestors in CUHK are reminded to refrain from throwing objects onto Tolo Highway and MTR track. Such acts seriously hamper the safety of train system and threaten passengers’ safety.

Police were deployed to stop their actions. The group of rioters then ran to the footbridge linking to HK Poly U and entered the campus to escape from Police. When Police officers were carrying out arrest action on the footbridge, a large group of rioters suddenly appeared and threw petrol bombs, glass bottles and hard objects at the footbridge from the campus. To protect the safety of the arrested persons and Police officers and to handle the crime scene, Police entered the HK Poly U campus for a short period of time.

The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) today (November 8) applied to the High Court to clarify the terms of the interim injunction order granted on October 25, 2019 (with amendments dated October 28 and October 31 in 2019).




In today’s judgment, the Court recognised that there is a serious and prevalent issue of doxxing particularly against police officers and their families (including young children).




The Court also acknowledged that the Secretary for Justice is properly bringing this action as guardian of public interest.




It was common ground between the parties that:




1.    Acts of doxxing of police officers and their family members are not to be supported or condoned. HKJA agrees that there are serious issues of doxxing, and that it does not seek to prevent police officers from seeking legal protection of the Court.




2.    Whilst the injunction is not intended to stifle genuine and lawful journalistic activities, a journalist who engages in unlawful conduct amounting to public nuisance, harassment and/or intimidation would come within the terms of the injunction.




We reiterate that the injunction is not intended to target lawful and legitimate journalistic activities, and under the injunction granted by the Court today, journalists can continue to engage in such lawful and legitimate journalistic activities.




However, the injunction remains applicable in prohibiting acts beyond these boundaries. As emphasised by the Court in today’s judgment, freedom of expression is not absolute and is subject to legitimate restrictions. It is therefore important to refrain from acts which are prohibited by Court orders, including the various injunction orders (whether interim or final). Relevantly, unlawful disclosure of personal data intended or likely to intimidate, molest, harass, threaten or pester any police officer(s) and their families without their consent, whether by media or otherwise, would remain to be prohibited by the injunction.




Anyone who violates an injunction order may be subject to contempt of court and will be liable to a custodial sentence or be fined if held guilty of such contempt.
Police will implement special traffic arrangements this Sunday (November 10) to facilitate a public order event to be held on Hong Kong Island.

 Since this June, there have been numerous instances of violent protests and vandalising acts in many districts of Hong Kong including but not limited to criminal damage to property, assaults of the person, riots and arson.  The use of internet-based platform or medium, given its anonymous and instantaneous nature in communication as well as accessibility, have been abused by some to incite protesters to participate in unlawful activities, to promote the use of weapons and to mobilise protesters to damage targeted properties and injure targeted individuals (in particular police officers).  Such acts have seriously breached public peace, and posed a grave and genuine danger to the police and members of the public.




 The Secretary for Justice seeks this injunctive order to restrain such abusive use of internet-based platform or medium. The Court has granted an interim injunction which will remain in force up to and including Friday, 15 November 2019 at 10:30 a.m..

The Department of Justice represented the Secretary for Justice and the Commissioner of Police to apply to the Court for an ex parte injunction (HCA 1957/2019) earlier to restrain persons unlawfully and willfully conducting themselves in any of the following acts:




(a) using, publishing, communicating or disclosing to any other person the personal data of and concerning any Police Officer(s) and/or their spouses and/or their respective family members (namely parents, children or siblings), including but not limited to their name, job title, residential address, office address, school address, email address, date of birth, telephone number, Hong Kong Identity Card number or identification number of any other official identity documents, Facebook Account ID, Instagram Account ID, car plate number, and any photograph of the Police Officer(s) and/or their spouses and/or their respective family members (namely parents, children or siblings), without the consent of the Police Officer(s) and/or their family member(s) (as the case may be) concerned;

Since June, Police officers’ personal information has been unlawfully disclosed and widely published on the Internet. Such information includes schools and classes that their children attended. Police officers who had been “doxxed” were affected by different levels of nuisance and intimidation, including harassment by telephone calls, identities being misused to apply for loans and to make online purchases, harassing Police officers' family members by visiting their workplaces. Some Police officers or their family members even received letters threatening to hurt them brutally.




These acts constitute serious intimidation and harassment to the Police officers and their family members, causing grievous concern over their personal safety and mental distress.




The Secretary for Justice as guardian of the public interest and the Commissioner of Police as a representative on behalf of all Police officers seek this injunctive order to restrain anyone from conducting any of these acts. The Court has granted an interim injunction which will remain in force up to and including November 8, 2019 at 10.30am.

The Department of Justice represented the Secretary for Justice and the Commissioner of Police to apply to the Court for an ex parte injunction (HCA 1957/2019) to restrain persons unlawfully and willfully conducting themselves in any of the following acts:-




(a)    using, publishing, communicating or disclosing to any other person the personal data of and concerning any Police Officer(s) and/or their spouses and/or their respective family members (namely parents, children or siblings), including but not limited to their name, job title, residential address, office address, school address, email address, date of birth, telephone number, Hong Kong Identity Card number or identification number of any other official identity documents, Facebook Account ID, Instagram Account ID, car plate number, and any photograph of the Police Officer(s) and/or their spouses and/or their respective family members (namely parents, children or siblings), without the consent of the Police Officer(s) and/or their family member(s) (as the case may be) concerned;




(b)    intimidating, molesting, harassing, threatening, pestering or interfering with any Police Officer(s) and/or their spouses and/or their respective family members (namely parents, children or siblings);




(c)    assisting, causing, counselling, procuring, instigating, inciting, aiding, abetting or authorizing others to commit any of the aforesaid acts or participate in any of the aforesaid acts.




Since this June, Police Officers’ personal information has been unlawfully disclosed and widely published on the Internet.  Such information includes schools and classes that their children attended.  Police Officers who had been “doxxed” were affected by different levels of nuisance and intimidation, including harassment by telephone calls, identities being misused to apply for loans and to make online purchases, harassing Police Officers' family members by visiting their workplaces.  Some Police Officers or their family members even received letters threatening to hurt them brutally.




These acts constitute serious intimidation and harassment to the Police Officers and their family members, causing grievous concern over their personal safety and mental distress.




The Secretary for Justice as guardian of the public interest and the Commissioner of Police as a representative on behalf of all Police Officers seek this injunctive order to restrain anyone from conducting any of these acts.  The Court has granted an interim injunction which will remain in force up to and including Friday, 8 November 2019 at 10:30 a.m..

Following is the speech delivered by the Commissioner of Police, Mr Lo Wai-chung, at the Force Remembrance Day today (October 18):




 Colleagues and guests, we are here today to honour all members of the Hong Kong Police Force, both regular and auxiliary, who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to the community of Hong Kong. This solemn ceremony is also a fitting tribute to the dedication to duty and fortitude of all members of staff who have served in the Force over the past 175 years.




 Since the founding of the Hong Kong Police Force in 1844, members of the Force have been facing different dangers in the course of our duties. Without fear, we have always put the people of Hong Kong first in our determination to ensure the safety and stability of this city. In doing so, some members of the Force paid the ultimate price, and it is in memory of their sacrifices that we are gathered here in remembrance today.




 In the past few months, widespread social unrest has posed an unprecedented challenge to the Force and Hong Kong; the escalating violence has seriously disrupted public order and endangered the safety of the public and our officers. Our hearts are heavy; our responsibilities are immense. Difficult though it may be, by drawing strength from the courage and selflessness displayed by our fallen officers, I remain steadfast in my conviction that we can weather the storm and restore the law and order for our city.




 In this ceremony, we are also joined by members of the Hong Kong Police Old Comrades Association, the Royal Hong Kong Police Association and former Force members. Like the many who came before them, they represent the finest traditions of service to the community for which the Force is both famed and justifiably proud – traditions, which continue today and are passed on from generation to generation and that make the Hong Kong Police Force one of the finest law enforcement agencies in the world.




 To all of you present here today, may I ask you to remain standing, and following the “Last Post”, join me in observing a two-minute silence in memory of all those who have fallen in the line of duty.The Hong Kong Police Force held a ceremony at the Police Headquarters this morning (October 18) to pay tribute to members of the Hong Kong Police Force and Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force who have given their lives in the line of duty.

     With a view to upholding public order and ensuring the safety of Police officers and their family members who are residing in Disciplined Services Quarters and Police Married Quarters (the Quarters), Police yesterday (October 14) sought assistance from the Department of Justice to apply for an Injunction Order (HCA 1886/2019) for the Quarters to restrain:



 



(i)  unlawfully and wilfully obstructing, occupying or remaining on or hindering or preventing the passing or repassing of any road or passageway, whether vehicular or pedestrian, in the portion of public roads;



 



(ii)  damaging or defacing any part of the Quarters, entering any part of the Quarters without prior authorisation; interfering with the use and enjoyment of the Quarters by the residents thereat (including but not limited to entering the Quarters; obstructing or preventing access to any of the entrances of the Quarters; projecting light of such intensity and/or frequency that is capable of reducing a viewer's ability to see or producing any sensation of discomfort to any viewer onto any part of the Quarters by the use of laser emitting tool or equipment, spot light or flash light; and



 



(iii)  inciting, aiding or abetting any person to do any of the above acts



 



     Since August this year, there have been repeated instances in which large crowds targeting Police officers and their families had surrounded various Quarters. Wong Tai Sin Disciplined Services Quarters was one of the most regularly and seriously besieged Quarters. Other Quarters were also stormed and the level of violence has been escalating in recent weeks. For instance, in the small hours of October 5, six petrol bombs, two paint bombs, two acid bombs and other hard objects were hurled into the Sheung Shui Police Married Quarters.



 



     Such escalating illegal acts have caused serious harassment and inconvenience to the residing officers of Police and other disciplinary forces as well as other tenants of the Quarters, endangering their personal safety and even resulting in mental distress. Facilities of the Quarters were also severely damaged.



 



     Since there have been relevant malicious remarks in social media, the risk of reoccurrence of the above vandalism and storming act is deemed extremely high. There are also other evidences indicating the likelihood of reoccurrence of similar incidents which may pose relevant threat and constitute harassment/vandalism.



 



     In view of the above, the Secretary for Justice made an application for the Injunction Order, which was heard and allowed by the Court of First Instance.  The sealed copies of the Injunction Order, once obtained, will be published shortly onto relevant Government websites as well as the webpage of Hong Kong Police Force. It will also be posted at conspicuous locations of the Quarters.

     Despite Police’s objection, some people advocated unlawful protests in various districts. Since around 1pm yesterday, a large number of protestors participated in unlawful assemblies in districts including Causeway Bay, Sha Tin, Wong Tai Sin, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan. They blocked carriageways, set up barricades with miscellaneous objects and randomly conducted arson, disregarding the safety of nearby residents. A number of MTR stations were seriously vandalised. Some rioters even hurled petrol bombs at trains and onto railways in MTR stations, without regard for the serious consequences of their act. Some rioters set fire to Government complexes and damaged the offices of councillors and shops. Their acts were completely lawless. So far over 180 persons were arrested for offences of taking part in a riot, unlawful assembly, assaulting Police officer and possession of offensive weapon, etc.     In the operations, at least 25 Police officers were injured. In a dispersal operation outside Tuen Mun Town Hall at around 2pm, officers were surrounded by a large group of rioters who launched attacks with bricks and miscellaneous hard objects. The rioters later threw corrosive fluid onto the people at scene, causing burn injuries to the officers and reporters. At 3.40pm, a Police vehicle travelling at the junction of Waterloo Road and Nathan Road in Yau Ma Tei was sieged by radical protestors. When officers took dispersal action, they were attacked by the rioters with various hard objects including bamboo sticks. Having given repeated warnings to the protestors in vain and with their lives under serious threat, an officer fired two warning shots into the sky to protect their own safety.     At about 4pm, Police officers again encountered riotous attack while conducting dispersal operation on Tai Ho Road in Tsuen Wan. A large group of rioters attacked officers with iron poles, seriously threatening their lives. Having given warning but in vain, an officer fired a shot at a male attacker. The 18-year-old man was injured and rushed to Princess Margaret Hospital in conscious state. Officers also fired two warning shots on Sha Tsui Road in Tsuen Wan and one warning shot on Shatin Pass Road in Wong Tai Sin after giving repeated warnings to the protestors in vain and with their lives under serious threat.     Since the situation deteriorated rapidly, Police conducted dispersal operation with appropriate force, including tear gases, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds. The specialised crowd management vehicles were also deployed to stop the violent acts of the protestors.     Into the night, rioters continued to vandalise public properties across the territory and massively attack police stations with petrol bombs, seriously endangering public safety. Appallingly, some rioters gathered and beat up bystanders, taking the law into their own hands. They even launched fireworks at residence.     Since June, radical protestors have been repeatedly organising unlawful activities. Their violent acts are spreading and escalating drastically, including the use of fatal violence to attack Police officers. Public safety has been jeopardised and the public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation. Police reiterate that no violent behavior will be tolerated. Police will continue to take resolute enforcement action so as to safeguard the city’s public safety and bring all lawbreakers to justice.

     A large group of protestors participated in unlawful assembly in various districts across the territory since yesterday (August 31), despite Police’s objection and warning. Large-scale clashes broke out as protestors hurled petrol bombs at Government buildings and assaulted Police officers recklessly by bricks and iron poles. Some protestors even hurled miscellaneous objects and iron railings into MTR railroad and committed arson inside MTR station, completely disregarding the safety of other passengers. With such escalating violence and progressively lethal weapons of protestors, the safety of Police officers and other members of the public is seriously threatened. Police express severe condemnation against such acts.     Police had earlier issued notice of objection against a public event on Hong Kong Island yesterday. However, some people continued to call on protestors on the Internet to participate in unauthorised assembly in Wan Chai areas. At about 2pm yesterday, a large group of protestors marched through Hennessy Road to Central and set barricades along various throughways on Connaught Road Central, Harcourt Road and Des Voeux Road Central, seriously paralysing the traffic on Hong Kong Island.     At about 5pm, a group of radical protestors started storming Central Government Offices, Legislative Council Complex and Police Headquarters. They hurled petrol bombs, corrosives, bricks and miscellaneous objects at Police officers, and committed arson at various locations. Having given repeated warnings to the protestors in vain, officers conducted dispersal operations with appropriate force. The specialised crowd management vehicle was deployed to stop the violent acts of the protestors.     The protestors later went to Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and North Point, and blocked Hennessy Road, Fenwick Street and King's Road, etc. Some of them set fire to large barricades at the junction of Hennessy Road and Johnston Road. The fire was very fierce at one point, posing serious danger to nearby residents. Police again deployed the specialised crowd management vehicle to disperse the crowd.     At about 9pm, while conducting operations near Victoria Park, two Police officers were surrounded and attacked by a large group of violent protestors who once attempted to snatch Police pistols. With their lives under serious threat, the officers fired two warning shots into the sky to protect their own safety.     Other than Hong Kong Island, multiple batches of radical protestors also illegally assembled in various districts on Kowloon, including Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Prince Edward, Wong Tai Sin, Kwun Tong, Hang Hau and Tin Shui Wai. Police stations were besieged, roads were blocked, public facilities were criminally damaged, and a number of MTR stations were vandalised.     In the past months, radical protestors escalated their violent acts from blocking main thoroughfares to frequently using lethal weapons such as petrol bombs. Some of them even blatantly assaulted Police officers. The level of violence is rapidly escalating and their illegal acts have no regard to the laws of Hong Kong. Police will continue to take resolute enforcement actions so as to safeguard the city’s public safety and bring all lawbreakers to justice.Ends

Police earlier issued the Letter of No Objection for the public procession held in Tsuen Wan yesterday (August 25). However, some extremely violent protestors deviated from the original route, obstructing roads, vandalising shops and tunnel facilities, hurling petrol bombs, bricks and miscellaneous objects at police officers. Police severely condemn the protestors who purposefully harmed police officers.




 At around 3.35pm, some radical protestors blocked various roads in Tsuen Wan, including Luen Yan Street, Yeung Uk Street and Texaco Road, and set up barricades with water-filled barriers, bamboo sticks and other objects, paralysing traffic in Tsuen Wan. Having escalated their violence, protestors aimed laser beams and hurled bricks, hard objects and petrol bombs at police officers, apart from setting up barricades.




 In view of the escalated violence, Police issued multiple warnings to appeal to the protestors to leave but in vain. At around 5.30pm, police officers used appropriate force, including deploying tear gas and two specialised crowd management vehicles, to stop the violent acts of the protestors.




 At around 7.40pm, a large group of extremely violent protestors vandalised shops and entertainment venues at Yi Pei Square, Tsuen Wan. Emergency Unit of New Territories South was deployed at scene. The protestors hurled hard objects at police officers and attacked them with different weapons. Under attack, police officers guarded with shields and batons in retreat while giving warnings. However, the protestors continued to attack and injured police officers. One of the police officers under attack fell onto the ground. Being surrounded, under attacks and facing threats to life, six police officers withdrew pistols and stayed on guard while giving warnings to the protestors. In order to protect the safety of other officers and himself, one of the police officers fired a warning shot to the sky without any other choices.




 The protestors later went to various locations, including Sham Shui Po, Tsim Sha Tsui, Sha Tin and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, and aimed laser beams and hurled objects at police officers. They also vandalised facilities and set up barricades with miscellaneous objects at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel to paralyse traffic.




 During the operations, 15 police officers were injured and sent to the hospital for treatment.




 Police arrested 29 men and seven women, aged 12 to 48, for offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assaulting police officers.




 The protestors' violence disregarded the law and order. Police severely condemn such violence which was outrageous and have overstepped the bottom line of a civilised society. Only when there were violent acts or illegal behaviours which endangered the safety of people at scene, Police would stop them by proportionate use of force to prevent the incidents from worsening.




 Police appeal to members of the public to make a clean break with violent protestors and stay away from areas with violence. Police also hope that journalists could cooperate with operations of police officers and pay attention to their own safety. Police will take relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice.

From yesterday (August 4) to the small hours of today (August 5), a lot of radical and violent acts happened at multiple locations in the territory. Some protestors committed arson at various places, hurled bricks and hard objects at Police stations, as well as hurling suspected corrosive substances at Police officers. Police severely condemn the escalating violence of the protestors.




 There were public meeting and public procession in Tseung Kwan O yesterday afternoon in which participants departed from Po Tsui Park. During the event, the whole of Po Fung Road and part of the carriageway of Po Lam Road North were occupied by the participants. They also removed roadside fences on Mau Yip Road and set road blocks, causing serious traffic obstruction.




 On the other hand, some participants of the public meeting in Western District left Belcher Bay Park which was the original public meeting location, and headed to Central direction through Des Voeux Road West. The participants occupied the carriageways and set road blocks, then protested along Queen's Road West. Police urged members of the public assembling at scene unlawfully to leave as soon as possible through on-site broadcast, social media and press releases. Such warnings were repeated but to no avail, Police then used tear gas and appropriate force to disperse the protestors.




 At around 8pm, a large group of protestors from Western District headed to Causeway Bay and conducted unauthorised assembly. The protestors occupied the carriageways of Hennessy Road near Causeway Bay and blocked the roads by using fences, causing serious traffic obstruction. Some protestors deliberately damaged the traffic lights along Canal Road flyover, vandalising Government property and intending to paralyse the whole traffic network of the district.




 After that, some protestors proceeded to block Gloucester Road and both traffic lanes of Cross-Harbour Tunnel nearby, leading to complete closure of both ways of the tunnel tubes and traffic obstruction. During the blockage, an ambulance was stuck at the entrance of the tunnel tube.




 In face of the situation, after giving repeated but futile warnings, Police discharged tear gas at the junction of Hennessy Road and Percival Street to disperse the protestors. Protestors became increasingly violent during the dispersal operations. Some protestors set fire to a trolley of rubbish bins, wooden planks and miscellaneous objects, and pushed it towards Police cordon line on Percival Street. Police then used appropriate force to stop the violent acts.




 Later in the small hours today, the protests took place at various locations in Kowloon and New Territories. Protestors repeatedly confronted and assaulted Police officers. They also obstructed multiple tunnels and thoroughfares, including Tseung Kwan O Tunnel and Kwun Tong Road, paralysing the traffic. Hence, Police conducted dispersal operations in Wong Tai Sin, Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong and Tin Shui Wai respectively.




 A number of Police stations were also besieged and under violent acts of protestors. Subsequently, the report room services of Tseung Kwan O, Wan Chai, Wong Tai Sin, Kwun Tong and Tin Shui Wai Police Stations were temporarily suspended, which greatly affected Police’s provision of emergency services to the public.




 A series of radical and violent acts also happened outside Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong and Wong Tai Sin Police Stations respectively. Some protestors used self-made catapults to hurl bricks and hard objects into the Stations. Some even hurled suspected corrosive substances at Police officers. Furthermore, a large number of glass windows of the Stations were damaged. Some graffiti with content of insulting Police officers was drawn on the outer walls. Wong Tai Sin Disciplined Services Quarters was also once surrounded by protestors.




 During the operation, Police arrested 44 persons for offences including unlawful assembly and possession of offensive weapons etc. Police strongly condemn the radical protestors who disregarded law and order. Police reiterate that resolute enforcement actions will be taken against all illegal and violent acts.




 Police always respect the public’s freedom to express views and opinions, as well as the right to assembly. However, the violence of protestors is escalating rapidly in their recent illegal acts and the situation is getting out of control.




 Police reiterate that Police are capable and determined to maintain law and order and will not tolerate any violence.

Wong Tai Sin District, Mong Kok District, Kowloon City Division, Yau Ma Tei Division, Tsim Sha Tsui Division Police Station Report Room and MTR Hung Hom Station Police Reporting Centre service have resumed normal.
Police severely condemn the violent acts of radical protestors at the violent incidents happened at various locations in east and west Kowloon from yesterday night (August 3) to the small hours today (August 4).




There were public events in Mong Kong district yesterday afternoon. At about 4pm, a large group of protestors deviated from Police’s agreed public procession route, blocking Nathan Road while marching towards Tsim Sha Tsui. Some protestors removed the roadside fences and set road blocks at various major crossroads, causing serious traffic obstruction. The report room service of police stations in Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, as well as the Police Reporting Centre in MTR Hung Hom Station was suspended, affecting Police’s provision of emergency services to the public.




When the protestors arrived at Tsim Sha Tsui, they went to Hung Hom via Salisbury Road. They used water barriers, fences and other miscellaneous objects to block both traffic lanes of the toll plaza of Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom, leading to complete closure of both ways of the tunnel tubes, causing serious traffic obstruction.




After that, a large group of protesters assembled in Tsim Sha Tsui illegally again. Some radical protestors started to surround Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station, vandalising the facilities outside and setting fire at various locations. Furthermore, some protestors hurled bricks and hard objects into the Station by some large catapults, damaging over 20 vehicles inside and causing serious threats to the safety of people at scene.




With multiple arsons and criminal damages reported, thoroughfares extensively blocked, the situation in the vicinity of Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui further deteriorated. Police urged members of the public assembling at scene to leave as soon as possible through on-site broadcast, social media and press releases. Such warnings were repeated but to no avail, Police then took dispersal actions respectively in Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok.




During the dispersal operations, some violent protestors hurled petrol bombs, bricks, glass bottles and large amount of miscellaneous objects at police officers. The protestors also directed high-power laser at the officers, committed arson at various locations and pushed towards the officers a burning rubbish bin. The scene became increasingly chaotic when the protestors violently attacked other people with different views. Therefore, Police had to use appropriate force including the discharge of tear gas to stop the violent acts.




At around the same time, another group of protestors marched towards the direction of Wong Tai Sin via Prince Edward Road East. The report room services of Wong Tai Sin Police Station and Kowloon City Police Station were temporarily suspended. Much tension arose at the standoff between the protestors and Police officers at a bus station in Wong Tai Sin. When officers were trying to retreat from the scene by Police vehicles, some radical protestors surrounded them and vandalised the vehicles. Also, the protestors hurled miscellaneous objects at the officers and vehicles, and some even used fire extinguishers to attack the officers at scene.




A gang of violent protestors subsequently surrounded Wong Tai Sin Disciplined Services Quarters, hurling fireworks and numerous miscellaneous objects into the quarters, breaking the glass windows of lower-floor residential units, damaging the gates of the car parks and other Government property. The safety of the residents was seriously threatened. In face of the chaotic situation, tear gas was launched to disperse the protestors. Shortly after that, protestors turned to Lung Cheung Road and blocked it with water barriers and miscellaneous objects, causing severe traffic obstruction to the thoroughfare. Protestors also blocked the traffic lanes of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom again.




During the operation, Police arrested over 20 persons for offences including unlawful assembly and assault etc.

Police severely condemn the illegal acts by a group of radical protestors who vandalised numerous government property, setting fires, attacking Police officers with various lethal weapons during protests in Sai Ying Pun and Sheung Wan yesterday (July 28).




 Although the Police have clearly objected to the application for a public procession from Chater Garden to Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park, the Police facilitated the organiser in holding a public meeting in Chater Garden, Central. However, at around 3.30pm, which was about half an hour after the meeting started, a large group of protestors proceeded eastward and westward, blocking carriageways in Sai Ying Pun and Causeway Bay respectively, causing traffic obstruction in a number of areas on Hong Kong Island. According to the law, this was an unauthorised assembly. In addition, protestors in Causeway Bay destroyed government property and created road blocks, causing serious traffic obstruction.




 At 7pm, the radical protestors who gathered around Western Police Station hurled miscellaneous objects such as bricks at Police officers. To prevent the situation from deteriorating, Police stopped such dangerous behaviours with appropriate use of force and conducted dispersal operation. The use of tear gas was to establish a safe distance between protestors and the Police in order to avoid direct confrontation.




 During the dispersal operation, radical protestors set fires at various locations. At the junction of Des Voeux Road Central and Morrison Street, some even set fire to a trolley of carton papers and used objects. They pushed the burning trolley to Police officers, seriously threatening the safety of everyone at scene. Radical protestors also burnt miscellaneous objects inside a rubbish bin at the junction of Queen's Road Central and Morrison Street.




 Also, the radical protestors attacked Police officers with blatant disregard for the consequences. Such attacks included hurling bricks, glass bottles, paint bombs; pouring suspected corrosive liquids; and shooting metal marbles with a crossbow. Large traffic signs removed from kerbs and hefty objects were hurled from height at Police officers near Rumsey Street in Sheung Wan, posing serious threats to their lives. Police also seized at scene bows and arrows which are lethal weapons.




 Regarding the incident yesterday, Police have arrested at least 49 persons for offences including unauthorised assembly and possession of offensive weapon.




 The radical protestors’ acts were getting increasingly violent. They escalated from removing railings, hurling metal poles and bricks to extensive arson and destruction. Police severely condemn such behaviours which have obviously deviated from the principle of expressing opinions in a peaceful manner. Police reiterate the determination and capability to bring offenders to justice.

In the first half of 2019, Police continued to strengthen enforcement actions in view of the overall traffic situation. In the first six months of 2019, the number of enforcement actions taken against congestion related and moving vehicle offences amounted to 1,295,134 (including fixed penalty tickets, summonses and arrests), an increase of 27,151 comparing to the corresponding period of last year.




 There were 7,565 traffic accidents (with person injured) in the first half of 2019, representing a drop of 165 cases (down 2%) when compared with the same period of last year. Among them, 49 were fatal traffic accidents, a drop of 11 cases (down 18% ). A total of 9,375 persons were injured in traffic accidents, a decrease of 52 persons. There were 50 fatalities (29 were pedestrians, 16 were drivers and 5 were passengers), reduced by 29 persons from the corresponding period of last year (down 37%).




 In the first half of this year, 1,433 pedestrians were injured or killed in traffic accidents, down 7% when compared with the corresponding period of last year. Police noticed that elderly citizens were the most vulnerable group.  Among the 29 pedestrians killed in traffic accidents in the first half of 2019, 17 were aged 65 or above, amounting to 59% of the total number of pedestrian fatalities. The major cause of such fatal accidents was crossing carriageway without paying attention to the road situation.




 In addition, from January to June 2019, there were 1,560 traffic accidents caused by “inattentive driving”, accounting for 21% of the total number of traffic accidents. Twenty-two were fatal traffic accidents, down 8 cases from the corresponding period of last year. The number of fatalities decreased by 25 to 23 persons but it still accounted for about half of the number of fatalities in traffic accidents. According to Police figures, “inattentive driving” has been the top contributory factor for traffic accidents since 2009, and so motorists’ driving attitude continued to be a concern.    




 In the first half of 2019, there were 103 traffic accidents involving drink driving, a drop of 9 cases (down 8%) from the corresponding period of last year. A total of 391 persons were arrested while the number of casualties was 72.




 Road safety is one of the Commissioner’s Operational Priorities in 2019.  Aside from enforcement action taken under the Selected Traffic Enforcement Priorities programme, Police made effort to raise road safety awareness among road users, in particular senior citizens. More than 150 pedestrian safety activities were organized to publicise and educate the public in the first half of 2019. Police will continue to promote road safety, and will apply technology to assist enforcement work.




 The new version of the “Automatic Number Plate Recognition System” came into full operation in March 2019. The system was installed in large estate vehicles operated by traffic officers, with cameras to identify four types of offending vehicles, namely "Unlicensed Vehicles", "Vehicles Licensed to Disqualified Drivers", "Vehicles Licensed to Persons Wanted for an Outstanding Traffic Warrant" and "Stolen Vehicles". When the system identifies a vehicle suspected in connection with the above, police officers will stop the vehicle for further enquiry. If other offences are disclosed during enquiries, officers will also take appropriate enforcement actions.   




 Starting from the third quarter of 2019, Police will introduce a pilot scheme on Electronic Fixed Penalty Tickets in seven Police Districts (including Wan Chai, Wong Tai Sin, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, Sha Tin, Yuen Long and Tai Po Police Districts). Under the scheme, 200 frontline Uniformed Branch police officers and traffic wardens will make use of mobile phone applications to capture the vehicle details by scanning the QR Code on the vehicle license to process illegal parking offences electronically and use portable printers to issue the tickets, thereby raising enforcement efficiency and accuracy.




 Two 3D laser scanners were purchased in March 2019 for trial use in traffic accident investigation. Laser scanning can thereby reducing the time needed for enquiries at the scene. The Force will review the use of 3D laser Scanner and consider to equip all Regional Traffic Formations with the device in the future.




 Upon the commissioning of the Hong Kong Section of Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link and Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, the usage of roads in nearly areas has been rising. The Force has implemented corresponding deployment and traffic control to ensure road safety and reduce congestion.




 The roads in areas of Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai were open for traffic in the first half of 2019 while the Boundary Control Point is expected to be commissioned in the second half of this year. The Force will make reference to past experience to implement appropriate measures with other Government Departments to ensure smooth traffic flow.




 In conclusion, the Force will continue its efforts towards promoting road safety and will explore the use of technology to make traffic enforcement more efficient. The Force will continue its efforts towards ensuring a smooth traffic flow and making our roads safer for all through a combination of engagement and enforcement.


In the first half of 2019, a total of 25 295 crime cases were recorded, representing a decrease of 1 255 cases or 4.7% when compared with the same period of last year.  The overall crime figures hit a record low since 1977 in which half-year crime statistics were first kept.




 There were 3 970 cases of violent crime in the first half of 2019, a decrease of 9% when compared with the same period of last year.




 1.     Major crimes recorded decreases




 In the first half of this year, crimes recorded decreases included homicide, robbery, burglary, serious drug offences, wounding and serious assault, and criminal intimidation, etc.




 There were 11 cases of homicide, representing a decrease of 6 cases or 35.3% when compared with the same period in 2018.  These cases arose from disputes between couples, family members, friends, residents in residential care homes, etc.  All cases were detected.




 There were 44 cases of robbery reported, representing a significant drop of 38 cases or 46.3% when compared with the same period of last year.  The number of street and convenience store robberies decreased by 31 cases or 63.3%. Police will continue to strengthen the work on intelligence and investigation, including collaboration with the Mainland and overseas law enforcement agencies, to prevent and detect robberies so as to neutralize related crime syndicates.




 A total of 586 serious drug cases were recorded, representing a drop of 146 cases or 19.9% when compared with the same period in 2018.  The seizure amount of cocaine, ketamine, cannabis and heroin increased while the amount of methamphetamine (Ice) seized dropped.  The increase in the seizure amount was attributed to multiple successful operations conducted by the Police and the Customs and Excise Department respectively.  In recent years, some overseas countries and regions legalized the use of cannabis for medical or recreational purpose.  Nonetheless, possessing, consuming or trafficking cannabis or products containing controlled cannabis compounds constitutes a criminal offence in Hong Kong. Members of the public should pay attention to relevant local legislation while traveling abroad during summer vacation, and be mindful of products containing cannabis compounds so as to avoid contravening the law inadvertently by bringing them back to Hong Kong.




 2.  Major crimes recorded increases




 In the first half of 2019, crimes that registered increases included deception and sexual offence.




 A total of 3 855 cases of deception were recorded, representing a rise of 184 cases or 5% when compared with the same period in 2018.  Such increase mainly stemmed from telephone deception and e-shopping fraud.




 2.1   Telephone deception




 Telephone Deception totalled 231 cases, representing a rise of 66 cases or 40%.  The two common modus operandi were “Pretend Officials” (108 cases, increase of 83.1%) and “Guess Who” (122 cases, increase of 22%).  There was only 1 case of “Detained Son” recorded (decrease of 83.3%).  The pecuniary loss involved in telephone deception totalled $53 million, being a 4-fold increase.  Near 90% of the loss was attributed to “Pretend Officials” cases, pecuniary loss of which totalled $46 million, reaching a 9-fold increase.




 Other than instructing the victims to make deposit to designated bank accounts, fraudsters also lured the victims to set up new bank accounts, and subsequently asked them to disclose the banking details and passwords on various pretexts in order to have direct control over victims’ bank accounts.  This often siphoned off all savings of the victims in the account causing the significant increase in total monetary loss.




 Telephone deception became more prevalent among the young people.  Victims aged below 30 increased by around 40% over the same period of last year.  Majority of them were victims of “Pretend Officials”.




 In light of this, Police will continue to alert the public of the latest modus operandi through different channels and social media, including the Hong Kong Police Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Weibo, etc.




 2.2 E-shopping fraud




 A total of 1 084 cases of e-shopping fraud were reported, representing a rise of 135 cases or 14.2%.  The total loss was $13 million, representing a drop of 27.3%.




 To raise the awareness of the public, Police has strengthened collaboration with online trading platforms and mobile apps to disseminate anti-deception messages to remind the public to remain vigilant when trading online.




 By the end of June this year, the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre (ADCC), which has been established for two years, has successfully intercepted over $2.7 billion of payment in collaboration with the banking sector.  This year, Police managed to intercept a remittance of $21 million to an overseas bank, in cooperation with overseas law enforcement agency for the first time.




 2.3 Sexual offence




 In the first half of 2019, an increase was recorded for sexual offence, including rape and indecent assault.  There were 29 rape cases, representing an increase of 6 cases or 26.1% when compared with the same period of last year.  One case was committed by stranger and has been detected.  For indecent assault, 573 cases were recorded, representing an increase of 36 cases or 6.7%.




 Cases in which the victims acquainted with the offenders via the Internet totalled 16 cases, which was the same as last year.




 To prevent sexual offences, Police will enhance publicity and education, particularly on social networking traps, on the Internet, at schools and during activities of youth organizations.




 3. Triads, domestic violence and youth crimes




 Other cases of public concern include triad, domestic violence and youth crimes.




 In the first half of 2019, triad-related crimes totalled 777 cases, representing a drop of 6.9% when compared with the same period of last year.  During the period, the Force mounted a series of large-scale anti-triad operations, including the territory-wide “Operation LEVINGTON” in April.  Over 500 persons were arrested for drug trafficking, money laundering, loansharking, operating gambling establishment, possession of offensive weapon, etc.  In addition, to combat triad-controlled illegal gambling activities in licensed game centres, Police mounted “Operation WISEBOLD” with 135 persons arrested and seizure of more than 150 game machines used for gambling.




 Police will show no tolerance or leniency towards triad-related crimes, and will continue to proactively combat all triad activities, including conducting large-scale intelligence-led anti-crime operations, undercover operations, as well as conducting financial investigation to intercept crime proceeds of the syndicates.




 There were 633 domestic violence (crime) cases in the first half in 2019, representing a decrease of 9.3%.  A total of 294 cases of domestic violence (miscellaneous) were received, representing a rise of 52.3%.  Family violence (crime) totalled 398 cases, representing a drop of 17.6%.




 A total of 1 234 youths were arrested for crimes in the first half of 2019, representing a drop of 17.7% when compared with the same period of last year.  Most of them were arrested for shop theft, wounding and serious assault, and miscellaneous theft.




 4.  Conclusion




 Combating technology crime continues to be one of the Force’s operational priorities. The Internet and social media have become part of citizens’ daily life, such as for online trading and making friends. More fraudsters take advantage of online channels to prey on potential victims. To raise the vigilance of the public, Police will alert citizens of the latest pitfalls through different platforms, including the media, social media of the Hong Kong Police Force, ADCC, etc. Police will also enhance the overall capabilities in detecting technology crime and further equip investigating officers with professional knowledge via trainings.




 Police will continue to carry out duties with utmost dedication, serve faithfully and impartially, and maintain the law and order in our best endeavors.Annex (Comparison of Crime Situation (2019 Mid-Year vs 2018 Mid-Year))

 (3) Public meeting at Victoria Park and public procession to Wan Chai




 Crowd safety management measures



 --------------------------------




 The public event consists of two parts, namely a public meeting at football pitches 1 to 6 and Central Lawn of the Victoria Park followed by a public procession heading to Wan Chai.




 The public meeting at football pitches 1 to 6 and Central Lawn of the Victoria Park will commence at 3pm and the subsequent public procession will start at 3.30pm. The public procession will set off to the junction of northbound Luard Road and Johnston Road, via Gate 15 and 16 of the park, Causeway Road, Leighton Road, Irving Street, Pennington Street, Yee Wo Street and Hennessy Road.




 A. Arrangements for public meeting at Victoria Park




 Members of the public participating in the public meeting are encouraged to use public transport to go to the park and enter the football pitches from the west via Gate 6 and 7 (near Sugar Street and Great George Street); or from the east via Gate 14 (Hing Fat Street near Lau Sin Street).




 Participants who wish to enter the park are advised to go to football pitches Nos. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in sequence to await the start of the procession. When the six football pitches are fully packed with participants, latecomers for the event may gather at the Central Lawn to await setting off the procession. To ensure that the participants of the public meeting enter the park and set off the subsequent procession sequentially, the organiser and their marshals will implement crowd safety management measure thereat (see diagrams 1 and 2).




 Police and the organiser will adopt a principle of “First come, First go” in order to ensure the procession can set off from the park orderly and in sequence.




 The procession will set off at 3.30pm or when the participants have occupied about 85 per cent of the six football pitches, whichever is earlier.




 B. Arrangements for public procession




 The procession will proceed along the westbound carriageway of the procession route and the eastbound and westbound tram lanes along Yee Wo Street and Hennessy Road. The eastbound carriageway will be reserved as emergency vehicles access and used by other road users. Police will make decision on the opening of traffic lanes according to the prevailing condition.




 The crossing zones outside SOGO Department Store and Paterson Street will be suspended during the procession. Past experience has shown that many procession participants jammed in the procession at these two points, causing obstructions and delay to the main procession from the park. Moreover, it will also affect the traffic at the eastbound carriageway and its function as emergency vehicles access, posing serious risks to public safety and public order. Procession participants are requested not to jam in at these two points. People who intend to cross Yee Wo Street can use the subway of MTR, Sugar Street footbridge and Percival Street footbridge.




 After arriving in Wan Chai, participants should pay attention to the announcements made by the organiser and follow the instructions given by the Police or event marshals for a safe departure.




 To maintain public safety and public order, Police imposed several conditions to the organiser. The conditions include directing the finishing point of the public procession, and requesting the organiser to appeal to the participants taking part in fund-raising, hawking or any other propaganda activities to ensure that their stalls or temporarily-erected structures would not cause obstructions to the public procession or endanger the safety of the public procession participants or other road users.




 For the conditions regarding the finishing point of the public procession, the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions confirmed those conditions today (July 20). Police wish the organiser would respect the ruling, comply with the conditions imposed on the Letter of No Objection and endeavour to assist Police to ensure that the event will be conducted in a safe manner.




 Members of the public going to Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Tin Hau are encouraged to use public transport. They should pay attention to the temporary signage displayed on site and follow the instructions given by Police officers or event marshals.




 It is the policy of the Police to facilitate all lawful public order events and it will take measures to ensure public safety and public order. Police wish to co-operate closely with the organiser to facilitate a safe and orderly public event.




 Police appeal to the event participants to remain calm, be considerate and co-operative, as well as to express their views in a peaceful and rational manner.

Starting from June this year, a large number of public events were held at various locations in Hong Kong. Although most of them were conducted in a generally orderly manner, a large group of radical protestors violently charged the Police cordon line and attacked Police officers shortly after the public events concluded, turning the scenes into very chaotic and dangerous situation. Violent protests seriously undermine the rule of law.  The Police, with the mission of upholding the law of Hong Kong, would definitely stand at the forefront to maintain public safety and order.




Same as in the past, Police officers facilitated the participants in expressing their views during the public procession in Sha Tin yesterday (July 14) afternoon.   However, upon arrival at Yuen Wo Road, participants refused to follow the pre-agreed route and started blocking the roads in the vicinity of Sha Tin Rural Committee Road and Yuen Wo Road.   




 Afterwards, a large group of people unlawfully assembled along Sha Tin Rural Committee Road, Yuen Wo Road and Wang Pok Street. Equipment including helmets and goggles was distributed premeditatedly among protestors in a short period of time. Some protestors pried up bricks from pavements, stocked up considerable number of iron poles and other offensive weapons, demolished the railings nearby, and blocked the roads by railings and other miscellaneous objects.




Meanwhile, a group of violent protestors deliberately attacked Police officers and charged Police cordon lines with different materials including traffic cones and unknown powder. At around 7.50pm, in order to swiftly prevent the situation from deteriorating, Police repeatedly urged the protestors to leave as soon as possible. Other members of the public not involved in the protest were also advised to pay attention to personal safety and not to take part in any illegal act.   At around 8.30pm, Police further warned the protestors to leave immediately or else force would be used. Police dispersal action at around 9pm followed, intending to make the protesters leave in the direction of Sha Tin Railway Station as soon as possible.




After most of the protesters left, some violent protestors hurled bricks, umbrellas and hemlets at the Police on the platform of shopping arcades near Wang Pok Street and its vicinity, posing serious threats to the safety of Police officers and members of the public. Police officers entered the arcades and their platforms to stop their violent behaviour. While Police officers entered the arcades, the officers were repeatedly and actively attacked by protestors and miscellaneous objects were continuously thrown from height. Police thus deployed appropriate force to arrest violent protesters.




The dispersal action concluded at around 12am today (July 15). During the operation, Police arrested 47 persons, including 29 men and 18 women, for offences including unlawful assembly, assaulting police officers, obstructing police officers and possession of offensive weapon. Among the 13 police officers sent to hospital for treatment, five officers are still admitted.




The aim of Police enforcement is to maintain law and order and uphold the rule of law. Police will conduct active investigation into the recent violent acts and take enforcement actions to bring those responsible to justice.

In response to the public procession organised by the media sector today (July 14), a Police spokesperson replied as follows:




 Police all along respect press freedom and their right of reporting. Police also understand the need of the media to film Police’s operations. Police have been maintaining communication with media organisations so that both sides could have mutual understanding on their work. There would not be any change in this area of work.




 Since December 2015, Force Media Liaison Cadre (FMLC) was established under a volunteer basis and as a secondary duty. FMLC serve as a bridge between the Police and the media to facilitate the work of both sides as far as practicable under the condition that the effectiveness of Police’s operation will not be compromised. FMLC endeavour to assist both sides in discharging their work smoothly. Since its establishment, FMLC has fully fulfilled their co-ordination duties.




 In addition, Police have added elements in various levels of training to enable police officers understand the work of the media.




 Starting from June this year, a large number of public events were held at various locations in Hong Kong. Although most of them were conducted in an orderly manner, a large group of radical protestors violently charged Police cordon line and attacked Police officers shortly after the public events concluded. The scene turned into a very chaotic and dangerous situation. Media practitioners shall take care of their personal safety and avoid being in danger.




 The above situation is unprecedented. There is room for improvement in the coordination work between Police and the media. In the future, Police would enhance communication with the media and relevant training for Police officers.




 Regarding some cases in which media practitioners alleged to be treated unreasonably during reporting, Police would take appropriate follow up actions.

A public procession was held in Sheung Shui yesterday (July 13). It started from the basketball court outside North District Sports Ground at 3.30pm and ended at about 5pm as announced by the organiser.  




After that, a large number of people assembled unlawfully along Lung Sum Avenue, Lung Wan Street and San Wan Road.  Police found that in a short period of time, a large number of equipment like helmets and goggles were distributed premeditatedly. Some protestors collected a lot of iron poles and other offensive weapons, demolished the railings nearby, and blocked the roads by water barriers, railings and some miscellaneous objects.




Meanwhile, some protestors argued with other people at scene and attempted to charge and besiege Police officers when the officers intervened. A large number of violent protestors deliberately charged Police cordon lines and attacked Police officers with different weapons and objects including iron poles and suspected irritating powder and liquid, causing injuries to the limbs and faces of a number of Police officers. Ten officers were discharged from hospital after receiving treatment.




After repeated but futile warnings, Police took actions to disperse the protestors at around 8pm.  The dispersal action was concluded at 10.30pm yesterday and all the blocked roads were reopened.  During the operation yesterday, Police arrested two men for unlawful assembly and non-payment of fine.




One of the arrestees was suspected of obstructing the advance of Police cordon line. When Police tried to approach the man for enquiry, he suddenly escaped.  When arrived at a footbridge connecting Landmark North, he strode over the railings and attempted to jump off the footbridge.  Police officers immediately held the man and rescued him.  After initial investigation, he was arrested for unlawful assembly.




During the operation yesterday, Police found that certain Legislative Council (LegCo) members and other people stood before the Police cordon lines, blocking officers in moving forward. This not only obstructed Police in performing their duties but also caused danger to the personal safety of LegCo members themselves as well as Police officers, reporters and protestors.  Members of the public should not obstruct Police’s operations by any means or they might be liable to the offence of obstructing Police officers.




Police strongly condemn the deliberate attacks by violent protestors and stress that Police will investigate and resolutely pursue all illegal and violent acts.

Not only did they conduct unlawful assemblies in various locations but also charge Police cordon lines.   There have been repeated occupation and blocking of roads which severely paralysed the traffic, severely threatening public safety and public order.  When the above situation occurred, Police on one hand had to respect freedom of expression by the public, while on the other hand, maintained public safety and public order.  It was after striking a balance that Police decided on the suitable course of action to take at an appropriate time so as to fulfil their statutory duty in maintaining public safety and order. About 5.30pm yesterday (July 7), a public event concluded, in general, peacefully and orderly outside Hong Kong West Kowloon Station.  Afterwards, some protestors started to block Canton Road and northbound of Nathan Road and proceeded towards Mong Kok along Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordon and Yau Ma Tei.  During the course, Police exercised restraint, letting protestors express their views without impeding their action. However, when protestors arrived near Mong Kok, some of them started to occupy all northbound and southbound lanes of Nathan Road, completely blocking the most important thoroughfare in Kowloon area and seriously affected the traffic in the vicinity. At around 9pm, Police set up cordon line at the junction of Nathan Road and Argyle Street. Despite repeated warnings issued by the Police urging protestors to leave, some protestors refused to comply and even acted violently.  In addition, Police noticed the heavy crowd flow in the area, coupled with lots of narrow lanes, increasing the safety risk at scene. As such, Police decided to take dispersal action. During last night and recent operations, Police found that certain Legislative Council (LegCo) Members frequently stood before the Police cordon line, blocking officers in moving forward. This not only seriously obstructed Police in performing their duties but also caused danger to the personal safety of LegCo Members themselves as well as Police officers, reporters and protestors. The purpose of Police dispersal action was to restore public safety and order as soon as possible and to minimise the inconvenience caused to the public due to road blockage.Police appeal to the public not to obstruct its operations by any means or they might be liable to the offence of obstructing police officers. Police all along respect press freedom and their right of reporting.  Police also understand the need of the media in filming Police’s dispersal action.  Police will as far as practicable deploy members of Force Media Liaison Cadre to facilitate media reporting under the condition that the effectiveness of Police’s operation will not be compromised.  However, the Police also appeal to media practitioners to put their own personal safety first at the scene when covering public events or large-scale demonstrations.  For their own safety, media practitioners should also avoid keeping “zero distance” with Police’s cordon lines when Police are conducting dispersal action. Police understand the work of LegCo Members and are willing to explain Police work to them at an appropriate time, but this must be carried out without affecting Police operations and its effectiveness. It is absolutely impossible to suspend law enforcement operations, such as when the dispersal operation is taking place, to explain to Members. Police will continue to strive to ensure the safety and order of Hong Kong.
Owing to the maintenance works on the flag poles and the podium at the Golden Bauhinia Square, Wan Chai, the flag-raising ceremony scheduled at 8am today (July 8) will be suspended.
An organisation conducted a public event yesterday (July 7) in which public procession started at 3.30pm from Salisbury Garden and finished at the open area of Wui Man Road outside Hong Kong West Kowloon Station. The organisation announced the event completed at 5.30pm and it was generally peaceful and orderly. During the event, Police arrested one person for failing to produce proof of identity. Some protestors then gathered at the vicinity of Canton Road. They even blocked Canton Road around 8pm to 9pm. From 9pm, protestors occupied northbound of Nathan Road, passing through Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordan, Yau Ma Tei and arrived Mong Kok. Police set up cordon line at the junction of Nathan Road and Argyle Street. Police made repeated warnings to the protestors that they were participating in an unlawful assembly and urged them to leave or Police would take actions to disperse the crowd. After repeated but futile warnings, Police took actions to disperse the protestors around 11pm. During the process, some protestors resisted and police arrested five persons for assaulting a police officer and obstructing a police officer in the execution of duties. Police respect the public’s freedoms of expression, speech and assembly. It is the policy of Police to facilitate all peaceful public events while at the same time ensuring public safety and public order. Police strongly condemn the illegal acts of protestors for blocking the roads.
In response to Hong Kong Journalists Association’s statement issued at about 3.30pm today (July 7) which alleged that Police had requested the MTR Corporation (MTRC) to refuse journalists from entering Hong Kong West Kowloon Station (WKS), and an updated statement issued at 4.30pm today, which alleged that Police and MTRC blocked WKS and refused journalists from entering WKS for news coverage, Police issued the following clarification:




Police have not requested or suggested the MTRC to refuse journalists from entering WKS for news coverage. Police express the deepest disappointment and regret on these unfounded allegations.




WKS is managed by the MTRC. Police respect the MTRC for taking measures at WKS and are actively assisting its arrangements in order to ensure the safety of every user.

 Police respect the public’s freedoms of expression, speech and assembly. It is the policy of Police to facilitate all peaceful public events while at the same time ensuring public safety and public order.

 Police also noticed that some people on the Internet and social media had called on members of the public to take part in non-cooperation movements which involve various illegal acts such as provoking Police officers or storming buildings. Members of the public should comply with the laws of Hong Kong and maintain social order when expressing their views. Should there be any confrontation, they should protect their own safety, maintain a safe distance from the violent protestors or leave the scene immediately so as to give Police enough space to deal with any violent and unlawful acts. If the public spot any suspicious persons or objects, they should inform Police under safety circumstances.




 In order to facilitate the public order event in Kowloon today, the Transport Department will implement a series of special traffic arrangements in the afternoon where some roads in Tsim Sha Tsui will be temporarily closed and public transport will also be correspondingly diverted. Police officers will be on-site to guide motorists. Motorists should exercise tolerance and patience in case of traffic congestion, and observe the instructions given by the Police.




 In addition, the MTR Corporation has announced that some special logistics arrangement will be in place at WKS today. Members of the public and tourists are advised to plan their journey in advance and pay attention to the latest traffic announcements to avoid any delay caused by road closure and traffic diversions.

Police today (July 4) appealed to the public for information on a man who went missing in Tin Sum.  




Lai Sai-kou, aged 82, went missing after he left his residence in Sun Chui Estate yesterday afternoon (July 3). His family made a report to Police today.  




He is about 1.7 metres tall, 50 kilograms in weight and of thin build. He has a round face with yellow complexion and short grey hair. He was last seen wearing a light blue short-sleeved T-shirt, blue jeans and black and white shoes.




Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the missing man or may have seen him is urged to contact the Regional Missing Person Unit of New Territories South on 3661 1176 or 9689 7445 or email to rmpu-nts-2@police.gov.hk, or contact any police station.

Police will conduct risk assessment when deciding on the manpower deployment and actions to be taken in handling public events. Police actions on July 1 were taken as a result of a number of considerations and continued risk assessment. The risk assessment conducted for the July 1 events was comprehensive and complicated. One of the most important considerations was the vital need to protect the safety of those present at scene, including protestors, journalists, police officers and others.




 Police noticed on the internet beforehand that some individuals have claimed to resort to radical acts, including initiating “dust storm explosion” and “threaten to fight until death”. On July 1, protestors not only used offensive weapons such as mills barriers and iron poles, but also poisonous and inflammable chemicals to attack Police officers. If protestors tried to ignite the chemicals inside the Legislative Council Complex (Complex), which is an indoor confined space, the consequence would be unimaginable. The options on force to be taken were also very limited inside such an indoor confined space. Besides, protestors also controlled without authority the electrical installations inside the Complex which could turn the scene into total darkness at any time, critically increasing the risk faced by the people present at scene.




 In addition, when the protestors began to storm into the Complex, a large-scale public procession was taking place in the vicinity. Any Police action may affect people's emotions and lead to a deterioration of the situation, the consequences of which may be unpredictable.




 Based on the above considerations, Police did not take immediate actions at the Complex and had avoided as far as possible physical encounters with the protestors. As a result of these decisions, there were no serious casualties throughout the incident.




 Police will resolutely pursue the protestors for their illegal and violent acts at the Complex on July 1. The Organized Crime and Triad Bureau is now actively investigating and collecting evidence relating to the incident in order to bring the offenders to justice.




 Police reiterated that the actions taken on July 1 were a result of continued risk assessment and thorough considerations. Police hoped that there will not be unnecessary speculations about Police’s operation on the day.
